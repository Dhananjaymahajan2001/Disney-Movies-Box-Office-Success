# Predicting Disney Movie Box Office Success

## Project Description

Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has been captivating audiences with a diverse array of films spanning various genres. In this project, we will delve into Disney movie data to uncover how the popularity of these films has evolved over time. By conducting comprehensive analyses and hypothesis testing, we aim to identify the factors that contribute to a movie's box office success.

This project assumes a familiarity with data manipulation using pandas, basic visualization using Seaborn, and a working knowledge of statistical inference. We will employ two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for differences in means to make our conclusions.

## Project Tasks

### 1. The Dataset

We will begin by loading and exploring the Disney Character Success dataset. This dataset provides information about various Disney movies and their attributes.

### 2. Top Ten Movies at the Box Office

Identifying the top ten highest-grossing Disney movies will offer insight into the kind of movies that tend to succeed financially.

### 3. Movie Genre Trend

Analyze the trend in movie genres over the years to understand how the audience's preferences have evolved.

### 4. Visualize the Genre Popularity Trend

Using Seaborn, we'll create visualizations to present the genre popularity trend over time.

### 5. Data Transformation

To prepare our data for linear regression analysis, we'll transform and clean the dataset as needed.

### 6. The Genre Effect

We will conduct hypothesis testing to determine whether certain genres have a significant impact on a movie's box office performance.

### 7. Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters (i)

Calculate confidence intervals for the regression parameters to quantify the relationships between movie attributes and box office success.

### 8. Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters (ii)

Continuing from the previous task, we'll compute additional confidence intervals for regression parameters to refine our understanding.

### 9. Confidence Intervals for Regression Parameters (iii)

In the final step of calculating confidence intervals, we'll solidify our findings and conclusions about the factors influencing box office success.

### 10. Should Disney Make More Action and Adventure Movies?

Based on our analyses, we will provide recommendations regarding whether Disney should produce more action and adventure movies.
